The aim of this project is to predict a car's price according to its mileage using liner regression.

There are two programs:  
- a training program, which learns on the data.csv file in order to approximate the optimal parameter for the prediction function.
- a prediction program, which prompts the user for a mileagem and outputs the estimated price of the car
